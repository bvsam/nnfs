# Neural Networks from Scratch

This program allows a neural network built using basic Python and Numpy to run on provided inputs. It was created to develop a better understanding of how neural networks work.

This project was based off the [neural networks from scratch tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) from Sentdex.
